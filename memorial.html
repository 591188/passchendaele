        <h2 class="page-title">Passchendaele Memorial — A Poem</h2>
        
        <p>This poem will be placed on a plaque in the War Museum. It is about the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Passchendaele and the harshness that they braved. Despite the overall futility of the battle,  the people who braved the mud and tried their lives are to be regarded as noble heroes. The memorial specifically focuses on each soldier’s humanity and how they are “grounded” and carried on by those whom they love. In this way, the battle itself is not painted as particularly honourable or good, but the soldiers absolutely are.

        <p class="poem">In this barren place<br>
           this quagmire of hell<br>
           We stand, slip and fall<br>
           and some bid farewell<br>
           No moment of silence<br>
           no sound place to rest<br>
           For all men are forceful<br>
           while the sky so detests<br>
           On this foreign ground<br>
           so rife with our pits<br>
           We stand, slip and fall<br>
           as one of us quits<br>
           What’s so hard to think<br>
           yet harder to stare<br>
           Is what used to be<br>
           what now is so bare<br>
           In mud we are grounded<br>
           well grounded in wet<br>
           In those that we love<br>
           against all that besets<br>
           In mud we are grounded<br>
           the ground holds our lives<br>
           Wet, grimy, and slippery<br>
           yet through we survive<br>
           Where all men are forceful<br>
           and the sky so detests<br>
           Through mud we are grounded<br>
           as God can attest.

        <p>I chose this form of memorial because I feel that literary works can do such topics as this good justice. I also chose it because I’m not artistic and there’s no way I’d be able to make a statue or monument that <em>would</em> do it justice in any way, and a piece of money didn’t seem too appropriate.
        <p>I see in Canada’s future that nothing quite like this happens again; in particular, that one sole person’s pride and power leads to so much pointless waste. The weather was obviously no one’s fault and really rather unavoidable, but the mass loss of life for practically zero gain absolutely was.
        <p>There is already a Passchendaele memorial right on-site in the village of Passchendaele. This is a large, outdoor, physical memorial with inscribed stone. My memorial is a bit of a smaller one designed for museums, but intended to be in the same ballpark message-wise.
