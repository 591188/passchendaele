In 1917 General Douglas Haig, commander in chief of the British Expeditionary Force, launched an attack on the German-occupied Belgian town of Ypres. Brought into the battle was Canadian Lieutenant General Arthur Currie, commander of the four Canadian divisions. Currie objected to the attack, knowing that casualties would be high and overall strategic value limited. However, Haig did not heed Currie‘s concerns, and Currie was forced to proceed with the attack. The result was months of dangerous, muddy warfare with little overall gain. The Canadians eventually took the main territory on the 6th of November, and on the 10th of November the Battle of Passchendaele concluded with the final small areas of the ruined town having been reclaimed.
