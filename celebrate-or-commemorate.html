        <p>While the Battle of Passchendaele did end in victory for the Canadians and Allied forces as a whole, the Battle of Passchendaele really is something to be <strong>commemorated</strong>.
        <p>The Battle of Passchendaele was a direct result of poor risk assessment, poor holistic strategy, and especially excessive pride. General Douglas Haig, main planner and lead proponent of the battle, originally proposed another attack on German-held Ypres (Passchendaele) in hopes that it would grant passage to occupied ports on the English Channel, where U-boat bases operated.
        <p>When Haig proposed his plans, the Prime Minister of Britain, David Lloyd George, was “skeptical.” It involved a large loss of life and the possibility of no passage to the U-boat bases, which was the entire point of the assault. Nonetheless, the plan was approved. The assault was underway in mid-July, with artillery bombarding the occupied land. Unfortunately, heavy rain also came and lasted many weeks. Soon enough, the battlefield at Ypres was a muddy, holey, swampy nightmare. British troops attacked on the 31st of July, but proved unsuccessful in the horrendous conditions, making little progress while both sides attacked as viciously as they could.
