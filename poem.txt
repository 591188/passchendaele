In Mud We Are Grounded

In this barren place
this quagmire of hell
We stand, slip and fall
and some bid farewell
No moment of silence
no sound place to rest
For all men are forceful
while the sky so detests
On this foreign ground
so rife with our pits
We stand, slip and fall
as one of us quits
Whatâ€™s so hard to think
yet harder to stare
At what used to be
what now is so bare
In mud we are grounded
well grounded in wet
In those that we love
against all that besets
In mud we are grounded
for the ground holds our lives
Wet, grimy, and slippery
Yet through we survive
Where all men are forceful
and the sky so detests
Through mud we are grounded
as God can attest
