        <p>This book, written while the events of Passchendaele unfolded, tells us of the conditions of the battlefield in Passchendaele. It tells of how weather was a more formidable threat than the German enemy themselves, and of the bravery of the men who fought. The writer writes of bravery in apocalyptic conditions, which is probably a faithful recording of the thoughts and feelings of those there. It also says that the Canadians earned honour in their role of the recapturing of Passchendaele, but that it did not come without the standard price of victory, death, and pain. I feel rather mystified by the author’s descriptions of both the battlefield conditions and the bravery of the soldiers. These soldiers fought through all sorts of nasty things, the weather being just as bad, if not worse, than the enemy themselves, and so while the entire thing was largely futile, the men tasked with taking the land poured their life into it. So, though the battle should be commemorated because of all of the completely pointless waste, the actual soldiers out on the field were loyal to their respective countries and endured much pain in their work to do what their country wanted of them—bravery at its finest.
