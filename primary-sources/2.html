        <img src="Canadian-gunners-in-the-mud-Alfred-Bastien.jpg" width="600" alt="Canadian Gunners in the Mud, painted by Alfred Bastien; an artillery battery stuck in mud, with soldiers attempting to haul it out" class="primary-source-image">
        <br>
        
        <p>This painting by Alfred Bastien depicts Canadian soldiers attempting to haul an artillery battery out of a pit of mud in the swampy battleground in Ypres. The artist was there while the battle took place, and this painting was painted either right there on the scene, or else right after the battle. The fact that the battery has sunk into the ground highlights how swampy and wet the place is; the brush strokes used for the lower ground make it look like murky water. According to the source, the painting focuses more on the battery than the soldiers to depict how important the weapons were to the battle. The soldiers are working pretty hard to get it out, which emphasizes both the importance of the weapons and the hardy efforts made by the soldiers in the battle. Finally, the sunrise in the sky symbolizes how the battle has dragged on for days and nights, and perhaps additionally suggests some hope for the scene, despite the dreary, barren landscape in the rest of the work. So, the main themes here are the long, hard work and bravery of the soldiers, how their work was necessary for success, and how some hope survived in the otherwise dreary conditions that did not promote it.
